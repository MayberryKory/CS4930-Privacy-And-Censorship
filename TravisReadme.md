## EFF

I've been looking up on Electronic Frontier Foundation. They make the tests we are running our browser against, and they have lots of information on internet privacy.

## Privacy Badger

Privacy badger is the EFF recommended privacy blocker. Looking through their website I found a link to easylist. The easylist is a txt file of objects to block to increase internet privacy. The list includes ads and invisible trackers.
