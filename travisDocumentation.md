# What is coveyourtracks.eff.org

- this is a site to test our browser to see if it is meeting EFF standards

## What they test

- The user agent string from each browser
- The HTTP ACCEPT headers sent by the browser
- Screen resolution and color depth
- The Timezone your system is set to
- The browser extensions/plugins, like Quicktime, Flash, Java or Acrobat, that are installed in the browser, and the versions of those plugins
- The fonts installed on the computer, as reported by Flash or Java.
- Whether your browser executes JavaScript scripts
- Yes/no information saying whether the browser accepts various kinds of cookies and "super cookies"
- A hash of the image generated by canvas fingerprinting
- A hash of the image generated by WebGL fingerprinting
- Yes/no whether your browser is sending the Do Not Track header
- Your system platform (e.g. Win32, Linux x86)
- Your system language (e.g. en-US)
- Your browser's touchscreen support

## What is fingerprinting

Browser fingerprinting is anothir method of tracking web browsers other than tracking IP addresses and unique cookies. It looks for things like what machine you are on, what fonts you have installed, patterns with your settings, and other stuff to combine information that is not personally identifiable into something that is not.

## What are cookies

Cookies store chunks of information in your browser. Things like your account login information or what is stored in your shopping cart. They are save states of client side network.

## How does a tracker blocker work?

most tracker blockers cross refernce massive lists of tracking scrips and block any attemptsc to load them. [Duck duck go](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/)

### Other Option

Another technique is blocking Javascript. However, this breaks any website that needs javascript, not to mention it will also break electron.

### Most browsers have settings to turn them off

EFF says this mostly works. Lets dive into how chat gpt says we can deal with that

#### Chrome Privacy settings vs Electron

In Google Chrome, there are several settings related to tracking that users can adjust. These settings include:

1. **Cookies and Site Data:** Control how cookies are handled, including blocking third-party cookies or all cookies.
2. **Tracking Protection:** Enable or disable Enhanced Tracking Protection, which blocks various trackers and cookies.
3. **Do Not Track:** Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic to indicate that you do not want to be tracked.
4. **Ads Personalization:** Control whether you see personalized ads based on your browsing history and preferences.
5. **Safe Browsing:** Enable or disable Safe Browsing, which helps protect against phishing and malware by checking sites and downloads against Google's list of unsafe sites.

To adjust similar settings in an Electron app, you can use the following options in the `webPreferences` of your `BrowserWindow`:

1. **Cookies and Site Data:** Use the `session` module to manage cookies and storage.

   ```javascript
   const { session } = require("electron");
   session.defaultSession.cookies.set({
     /* options */
   });
   ```

2. **Do Not Track** Use do not track in main.js
   `javascript
    webPreferences: {
    doNotTrack: true
}
    `
3. **Ad Personalization ** We would rather just block ads
4. **Safe Browsing** Electron doesn't have safe browsing

## They recommend privacy badger browser extension

- Privacy Badger is not a all purpose ad blocker.
- Sends Do Not Track signal
- If a company ignores privacy badgers DNT signal, then privacy badger blocks the company
- Blocks tracking from third parties
- Cookie Blocking, block cookies that contain tracking ID's
- Utilizes fastly.com IP addresses on startup, it uses the information to refresh policies in a json and a txt file
- It requires access from your data for all websites in order to block information

## How about DuckDuckGo
